# Automater
This is my modification of the Python Automater.py script created by TekDefense - http://www.tekdefense.com/automater/

Again, the original Automater.py script was NOT CREATED BY ME.

Automater is a script that takes IPs, Hashes, URLs, or files with lists of them and queries many popular 

infosec resources such as VirusTotal, UrlVoid and many others.

I have created Windows batch files for automatic launching of the program, it should work without the need for Python to be installed.

I have also included automatic HTML report generation.
